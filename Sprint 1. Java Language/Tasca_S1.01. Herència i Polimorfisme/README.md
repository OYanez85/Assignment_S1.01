üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement

This project consists of a series of Java exercises organized into three levels (Nivell 1, Nivell 2, and Nivell 3). Each level contains different exercises aimed at demonstrating concepts such as object-oriented programming, polymorphism, and inheritance. Various classes represent different types of objects, such as instruments (StringInstrument, WindInstrument, etc.) and cars (Golf, Tiguan, etc.). The project also includes functionality to manage news articles across different categories (e.g., BasketballNews, FootballNews).
